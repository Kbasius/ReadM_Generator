# ReadM_Generator
Challenge Module # 7
<br>
<br>
<br>
## Description
<br>
This is a quick and easy to use ReadMe generator made useing node.js, for whenever the need arises.
<br>
<br>
1. My motivation to make this generator is mainly because I had to keep looking up how to make a high-quality Readme.
<br>
<br>
2. I built this because I wanted a faster way to make readme's for projects.
<br>
<br>
3. With this the time spent making and or trying to remember what to add, you can simply use this generator.
<br>
<br>
4. While making this I learned more about node.js, npm, and modules as a whole.

## Installation
<br>
You may access the generator by either pulling the repo via bash or Github Desktop.
<br>
<br>
If you have not set up an SSH key or simply do not wish to do so, you can simply download the zip files and extract them to the location of your choosing.
<br>
<br>

## Usage
<br>
Once the files are installed open up VS Code and the location you saved the files.
<br>
<br>
Right click on index.js and "Open with intergrated Terminal", this will bring up a terminal window either at the bottom of VS code or off to the side depending on your personal settings.
<br>
<br>
Type "node index.js" in the newly opened terminal window to initialize the generator.
<br>
<br>
Type your answers!
